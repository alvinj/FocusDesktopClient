I created this project as a 'base' ExtJS project that displays a login
window (form) and then displays some other cruft after you login.

The login form connects to the `php/login.php` script that is included
in this project. That script magically logs you in, and after that the
rest of the application is displayed.

To use this project:

* Clone it
* Change all references to Focus to your project name

After that, this base project should be working, and you can modify it as
desired.
